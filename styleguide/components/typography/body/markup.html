<p class="t-intro-body">We are United Designers, a not-for-profit global community of over four hundred designers and developers who share a passion for creating. We have a mix of channels geared towards serious design discussion and professional help as well as channels for day-to-day chatting and inspiration.</p>
<p class="t-body">We're always looking for people who love design, from students all the way to professionals. If this sounds like you, go ahead and apply! Take your time, since we do read through these when accepting or denying applications.</p>
